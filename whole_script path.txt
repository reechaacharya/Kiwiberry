1) Opening of account to premise

2)importing the reads file to premise account in project directory
sftp ra1150@premise.sr.unh.edu
put C:\Users\reech\Downloads\wetransfer_kiwi-fastqs_2022-04-21_1838.zip 
there were 10 accessions file in the zipped file
3)barcode text file was created for all the accessions
4)script1.sh is used to make the mock reference genome out of the reads 
5)two mock references were made; 1st one using all the 10 reads whereas in 2nd one only 1 read was used
6)script2.sh was used for alignment mapping of the reads with the developed mock reference
7)script3.sh was used for parsing the file
8)script4.sh was used for creating the vcf file this was done within the variants directory inside the project directory
9)script5.sh was used to create the overall summary file called descriptor file
10) descriptor file was used to create histogram in Rstudio

11)Script used in R
