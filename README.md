 **Kiwiberry**
Kiwiberry (Actinidia arguta) is an emerging berry crop within highly diverse Actinidia genus and has received the attention of horticulturalists and plant breeders due to adaptation to northern latitudes and the smooth edible skin. It is rich in vitamins (A, B8, C, E), carotenoids (lutein, beta-carotene), and minerals (potassium, calcium) (Latocha, 2017). They have also been shown to possess therapeutic value to anticancer (Yu et al., 2015), anti-fatigue, and anit-inflammatory properties.
