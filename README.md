   **Background** 
 
 
 **Kiwiberry**



Kiwiberry (Actinidia arguta) is an emerging berry crop within highly diverse Actinidia genus and has received the attention of horticulturalists and plant breeders due to adaptation to northern latitudes and the smooth edible skin. It is rich in vitamins (A, B8, C, E), carotenoids (lutein, beta-carotene), and minerals (potassium, calcium) (Latocha, 2017). They have also been shown to possess therapeutic value to anticancer (Yu et al., 2015), anti-fatigue, and anit-inflammatory properties.

**Objective**
- To create a vcf file with all the possible SNPs for kiwiberry genome using GBS-SNP-CROP pipeline
- To create linkage map from the genotypic data (but using rose data just for the sample)


**Methodology**
- All the computational work is done through premise after an account was setup.(done)
#Data - Data of 10 different kiwiberry accession was collected from Hale lab





**Findings**
